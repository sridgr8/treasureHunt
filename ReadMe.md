Code to solve the Treasure Hunt.

How did I solve it?

- Task 1: Random Access
    Click all the buttons one by one, not much needed here.

- Task 2: A Video Player
    Start the video playback, wait for about 9 seconds and then mute the playback.

- Task 3: Crystal Maze
    There were just the two mazes and I felt creating bfs/dfs algorithm to solve it would have been overkill. I just stored the mazes in a List and used that to solve the mazes.

- Task 4: Maps
    I went with the number of key presses rather than the coordinate values of the pointer, as this method felt faster to me and worked consistently.

- Task 5: Not a bot
    This was pretty straight forward as the correct value was available in the console logs, it was just a matter of retrieving the value and using it.

- Task 6: Socket Gate
    This one took me the most time as I had to learn the way Python works with WebSockets and then solve it.
